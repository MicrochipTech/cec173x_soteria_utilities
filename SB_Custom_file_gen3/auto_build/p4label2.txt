----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build 1000:
1. Added the support for the AP PUBLIC key path to be provided in the browse option
   which it points and support with the local dir of the PEM key path
   Fix of the AP public key of any type of algorthm to be provided
   Generate the hash of the AP public key 384 of provided key in the 
   browse option
2. AP CFG / APFW key mask should be given correctly and 
   path of the AP public key should also to be provided correctly

Build 0900:
1. Updated the version 9.0 to support the hash for each public key
2. Based on the key count , where they can select any kind of key algorithm in the browse option to 
 calculate the hash of hash binary

Build 0800:
 Generate the window for AP key hash generation restriction - For multiple times 

Build 0700:
1. 4 byte/1 byte restriction in the GUI as per datasheets for the variable
2. Genertae_sb custom data of colour change button
3.Public key count restrcition
4. Generate the window for AP key hash generation restrritction

Build 0600:
1. AP public key hash generation by the tool automatcially.

Build 0500:
1.Updated the 1 byte /4 byte display in the tool and dispaly the defalut value with zero
2. Help window fix to display multiple time when close and again if it opted to display the help window

Build 0400:
1. AP_PubKey- Key Count. Number of AP Public Keys Supported (max = 32 keys)

Build 0300:
1. updated the custom file generator to show which bytes are 32/8 bits

Build 0200:
1) Generated  the custom_file.txt which map the soteria related region which are configurable by the user
