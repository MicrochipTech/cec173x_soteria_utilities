OTP programming for CEC173x DevBoard using MPLABX and ICD4

This is a sample project used for OTP programming as per below procedure

1.Open MPLABX and Under MPLAB X Options/Preferences -> Embedded -> Generic Settings
	a.Set Debug Reset @ = Reset vector
	b.Debug startup = Halt at Reset vector

2. Open the mplabx_OTP_programming project. This is a prebuilt project for OTP programming using ICD4. 
   Replace the otp_<0xx>.hex file in mplabx_OTP_programming folder with new otp_<0xx>.hex generated using OTP generator 

3. Keep GPIO131 pin Low to enable OTP programming.

4. Set this project as the main project.

5. Debug Main project. The debugger should automatically stop after “Programming/Verify complete”.

6. In the Execution Memory window, go to the address of the Reset_Handler() which is 0xE2EAC. Right click on this line and select “Set PC at Cursor”.

7. Continue Debug. 
   Two LED's were used for OTP programming status.

   In Microchip EVB board, GPIO156 is LED5 & GPIO157 is LED4.

   LED5  -  GPIO156 - at start this goes LOW, in case if this LED blinks - its OTP programming fail.

   LED 4 -  GPIO157 - at start this goes High, at the completion of this OTP programming, this goes Low.
				 - if OTP programming fail, this LED blinks.
				 

   OTP programming success without failure indication - LED5 (GPIO156) & LED4 (GPIO157) both turns OFF.

7.	Power cycle the board
